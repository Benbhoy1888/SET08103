**CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION**

**Goal in Context**

As a statistician at the world health organisation, I want to produce
reports that show the total global population, and total population
based on a selected continent, region, country, district, or city.

**Scope**

World health organisation.

**Level**

Primary task

**Preconditions**

We know the role. The database contains total global total population,
total population by continent, region, country, district, and city.

**Success End Condition**

A report is available for the statistician at the world health
organisation.

**Failed End Condition**

No report is produced.

**Primary Actor**

Statistician at the world health organisation**.**

**Trigger**

The statistician at the world health organisation selects total
population reports from main menu.

**MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO**

1.  The statistician at the world health organisation presented with a
    menu to select from a total global population, total population by
    continent, region, country, district, and city.

2.  If the statistician selects world, this step is skipped, otherwise
    the statistician is requested to input which continent, region,
    country, district or city they would like to generate the population
    report for.

3.  When the statistician at the world health organisation enters their
    selection,  
    the report should be generated displaying the correct data from the
    correct category.  
    This should contain the columns: Name (i.e. world, which region,
    which country, which district, or which city), and Total Population.
