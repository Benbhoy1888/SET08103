<p>As a salesman, I need to be able to produce reports that can show the
most populous capital cities from smallest to largest and vice versa. As
well as this, the report has to be formatted into 3 categories: capital
cities in a continent by population, capital cities in a country by
population and capital cities in a region by population.</p>
<p>The user should be able to choose these categories from within the
program and be able to enter the respective search criteria to get the
desired result.</p>
<p>Benefit: For the salesman to be able to correctly identify which
cities are more populous and thus more profitable.</p></td>
