<p>As a health research assistant,<br>I want to produce reports that show the countries organised by population large to small for; the world, a continent or a region. I would also like the option to be able to input the top N to display.<br>This is so I can easily find countries based on population density for my research.</p></td>

<td colspan="3"><p><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Given the reports are selected from a menu<br>
when the assistant selects country report,<br>
then they will have options to select from world, continent or region categories.<br> 
When the assistant enters their selection,<br>
then the report should be generated displaying the correct countries from the correct category.<br>
This should contain the columns: Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population and Capital.
