<p>As a disaster risk management planner,<br>I want to produce reports that show all cities organised by population large to small for; the world, a continent, a region, a country or a district. I would also like the option to be able to input the top N to display.<br>This is so I can view which cities are most populated and where risk planning should be focused.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td colspan="3"><p><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Given the reports are selected from a menu<br>
when the planner selects city report,<br>
then they will have options to select from world, continent, region, country or district categories.<br> 
When the planner enters their selection,<br>
then the report should be generated displaying the correct cities from the correct category.<br>
This should contain the columns: Name, Country, District and Population.
