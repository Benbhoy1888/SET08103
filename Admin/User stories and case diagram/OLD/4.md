<p>As a civil engineer, I need to be able to produce reports that can
show the most populous cities based on an inputted range. As well as
this, the report must be formatted into 5 categories: cities in a
country, cities in a continent, cities in a region, cities in a district
and cities in the world</p>
<p>I should be able to choose these categories from within the program
and be able to enter a numeric value to return the most populous cities
within the range of that value.</p>
<p>So I can correctly identify which cities are more urbanized</p></td>

<td colspan="3"><p><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Start: Confirm the output of the report</p>
<p>Action: Compare the output of the report with the SQL queries in
order to confirm they are matching</p>
<p>Action Outcome: The report should match the SQL queries</p></td>
