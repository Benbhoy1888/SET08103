<p>As a university rep, I need to be able to produce reports that can
show the most populous capital cities based on an inputted range. As
well as this, the report must be formatted into 3 categories: cities in
a continent, cities in a region and cities in the world</p>
<p>The user should be able to choose these categories from within the
program and be able to enter a numeric value to return the most populous
cities within the range of that value.</p>
<p>So that I can correctly identify which capital cities with ehighest
populations have the best university</p></td>
