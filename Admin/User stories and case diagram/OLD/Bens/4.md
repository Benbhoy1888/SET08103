<p>As a salesman, I need to be able to produce reports that can show the
most populous cities based on an inputted range. As well as this, the
report must be formatted into 5 categories: cities in a country, cities
in a continent, cities in a region, cities in a district and cities in
the world</p>
<p>The user should be able to choose these categories from within the
program and be able to enter a numeric value to return the most populous
cities within the range of that value.</p>
<p>So the salesman can correctly identify which cities are more populous
and thus more profitable</p></td>

<td colspan="3"><p><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong></p>
