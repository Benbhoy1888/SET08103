<p>As a salesman, I need to be able to produce reports that can show the
most populous cities from smallest to largest and vice versa. As well as
this, the report must be formatted into 3 categories: cities in a
continent by population, cities in the world by population and cities in
a region by population</p>
<p>The user should be able to choose these categories from within the
program and be able to enter the respective search criteria to get the
desired result</p>
<p>So the salesman can correctly identify which cities are more populous
and thus more profitable</p></td>
