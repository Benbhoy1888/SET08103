<p>As a property development planner,<br>I want to produce reports that show urbanisation organised by total population large to small for; a continent, a region or a country.<br>This is so I can understand the movement of people and see if people are moving to cities or the country to better plan our development projects.</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td colspan="3"><p><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Given the reports are selected from a menu<br>
when the development planner selects Urbanisation report,<br>
then they will have options to select from continent, region or country categories.<br> 
When the development planner enters their selection,<br>
then the report should be generated displaying the correct data from the correct category.<br>
This should contain the columns: Name, Total Population, Total population living in cities (with %), Total population not living in cities (with %).
