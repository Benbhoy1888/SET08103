<p>As an administrator, I need to be able to produce reports that can
show the most populous countries from smallest to largest and vice
versa. As well as this, the report must be formatted into 3 categories:
countries by population, countries in a continent by population and
countries in a region by population</p>
<p>I should be able to choose these categories from within the program
and be able to enter the respective search criteria to get the desired
result</p>
<p>So I can correctly identify the population of different
countries</p></td>

<td colspan="3"><p><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Start: Confirm the output of the report</p>
<p>Action: Compare the output of the report with the SQL queries in
order to confirm they are matching</p>
