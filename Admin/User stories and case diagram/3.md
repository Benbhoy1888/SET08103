<p>As a tour guide, I need to be able to produce reports that can show
the most populous cities from smallest to largest and vice versa. As
well as this, the report must be formatted into 3 categories: cities in
a continent by population, cities in the world by population and cities
in a region by population</p>
<p>I should be able to choose these categories from within the program
and be able to enter the respective search criteria to get the desired
result</p>
<p>So that I can decide which city is best to take their tour
group</p></td>
