<p>As a salesman, I need to be able to produce reports that can show the
most populous capital cities from smallest to largest and vice versa. As
well as this, the report must be formatted into 3 categories: capital
cities in a continent by population, capital cities in the world by
population and capital cities in a region by population</p>
<p>I should be able to choose these categories from within the program
and be able to enter the respective search criteria to get the desired
result</p>
<p>So I can correctly identify which capital cities are more populous
and thus more profitable</p></td>
