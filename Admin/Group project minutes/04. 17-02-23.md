### **Progress since last meeting:**  
* 1st release created on GitHub  
* Completed 1st code review - Javadoc comments missing, to be included in future  
* Questions that were asked last meeting answered:  
    * How many user stories, 7 or 1 for each task -
        * **There should be 5 user stories (one for each category- country, city, population etc.), these should be made up, but not generic (as a sales person/hr manager ect, I ….. how add value)..(see lecture 10 slides(under unit 5) and lab 3)**  
        * **Then 1 defined use case per story (template in lecture 10 slides (under unit5) and lab 5). All reports/tasks should (for particular category) should be listed here.**  
        * **1 use case diagram, this should show all user stories (see lab 5)**  
    * Can Zube be integrated via intelliJ? - **YES, and should be**  
    * Kanban board, 1 for project, 1 for each sprint?? -
        * **zube and kanban is covered in this weeks lab (lab 4) but we should have 1 project board showing all backlog tasks, ready and done/complete. We should then have a sprint board which shows particular tasks for a sprint, ready, progress, done, blocked**  
* Andy sorted docker compose, and loaded database, however need to check with Kevin that its loaded in right  
* Ben has mostly completed users stories, going to convert to markdown and make some minor changes  
* Tim - created 7 user stories to reflect SQL queries. However, will explore the data structures of the database to see how the tables and class objects may affect the user stories.  
* Emma has setup zube, and started to populate.
